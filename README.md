# Waste Classification using Advanced CNN for Smart Recycling

## 🌍 Overview
This project uses an advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste as **Organic** or **Recyclable**, promoting smart and sustainable recycling practices.  
Developed as part of the **AICTE-Edunet Internship (AI/ML in Sustainability)**.

## 🧠 Week 2 Progress (60% Completion)
- Integrated dataset from Kaggle (Organic/Recyclable categories)
- Implemented advanced CNN with BatchNormalization and Dropout
- Applied EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint for better generalization
- Trained model achieving ~90% accuracy
- Prepared accuracy/loss visualizations

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV
