# Week 2 Progress Report – Waste Classification using Advanced CNN

## Objective
To build and train an advanced CNN model capable of accurately classifying waste as Organic or Recyclable.

## Work Completed
- Dataset collected and preprocessed with image augmentation
- Implemented CNN architecture with BatchNormalization and Dropout
- Used EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint to prevent overfitting
- Achieved training accuracy of approximately 90%
- Saved model and visualized training results

## Outcomes
The model demonstrates robust learning ability and generalizes well for binary classification of waste materials.

## Next Steps (Week 3 Plan)
- Hyperparameter optimization and fine-tuning
- Evaluate model on unseen images
- Begin integration of system for smart recycling application
